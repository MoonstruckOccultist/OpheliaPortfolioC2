# OpheliaPortfolioC2
was tasked with making a website to be a portfolio
made a nav menu to go to about me, work showcase, and contact me sections of the page
since i dont have much to diplay right now i made the images link to my first challenge and a good song
should also look nice on mobile formats

i bashed my brain around trying to solve the frustrating problems the images brought up and just settled on this

future improvements: makes the smaller images display in a 2x2 way, actually add a bio, align the little separators, make the color scheme ~~be more appealing to boring braindead morons~~ use more neutral colors.
